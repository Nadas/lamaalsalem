	                Hello there, my name is Lama Alsalem, and I’d like to informally tell you more about myself. I received the majority of my education in the United States. I 							grew up between the Midwest and West coast. Throughout my childhood and my young adult years, I was exposed to many different cultures and societies.  As a result, 					I was always curious about societal norms and practices. </p><br>
                        
                    <p>Leading up to my high school years, I graduated from one of the top schools in the nation, where I studied sociology as an elective, and fell head over 								heels with this particular subject. During my undergraduate studies, I devoted my time to exploring careers within sociology. I remember starting my first 								internship at the Laguna Beach Youth Shelter where I got a closer look at social work, and how rewarding this career path could possibly be. I went along to 							continue exploring this career by taking multiple other internships within social work, but in different  areas. </p><br>

					<p>After graduating from Chapman University with a degree in sociology, and a minor in Women’s study, I decided to pursue my graduate studies in Social work at the 					University of Southern California. While attending classes five days a week, I was also working at a public school in Los Angeles. Everyday I would interview 							troubled students or students who were exposed to some type of abuse at home. Even though this job was mentally exhausting, the satisfaction of helping these 							young students was all worth it at the end. </p><br>

					<p>After two years of attending USC and working, I received my masters in Social work. Afterwards, I made a life changing decision by moving overseas to Saudi 							Arabia to work for Alwaleed Philanthropies. I had one of the best experiences at the foundation where I was offered complete confidence and transparency. I traveled 					to Europe and North America to oversee the foundation projects. For example, one of my tasks required that I traveled to D.C. for a period of three days to meet 						with United Nation officials to facilitate meetings and assignments.   </p><br>

					<p>Furthermore, I was offered a public relations position as a second job within the foundation. This would mark the beginning of my interest and transition into 						the PR industry. My day to day tasks involved communicating with journalists, news outlets, and other media channels. My interest and devotion to public relation 						only grew since then. </p><br>

					<p>I hope I did not bore you with my educational and career summary. </p><br>

					<p>Best Regards,
					<br>Lama Alsalem </p>
